# Workbook card readiness — 3 November 2026

**Historical assessment:** the counts below describe commit 488195e. See the [subsequent data-only implementation and complete in-scope dispositions](workbook-data-only-batch-2026-11-03.md) for the ten added cards, clarified terms and explicit BP01/Void/dual-color exclusions.

The [shared-query follow-up](card-query-architecture.md) subsequently removes the basic zone/filter blockers and adds another five cards.

The [rule-contract follow-up](rule-contract-architecture.md#what-this-removes-from-the-blocker-list) adds conditional modifiers, cast pricing and passive event-replacement authoring. It adds no workbook cards; its blocker table distinguishes supported mechanics from remaining wording and engine work.

**Reviewed commit:** 488195e. Read-only workbook assessment; no cards/rules were changed. Local source: tem/六界之峰.xlsx (ignored author workbook, not a committed repository dependency). SHA-256: 27b91d995e22fb8540a04c78a73d41f64daa08b216b275aceb1f282723a64d7d.

## What the numbers mean

79 registered JSON definitions exist: 71 map by normalized printed name to workbook rows, seven are development fixtures and one is Crimson Hellkite. The nine populated card sheets contain 277 named rows and 270 distinct normalized labels, including duplicate Void entries and placeholders. 71 rows match definitions; 206 named rows do not. BP01 also has 34 unnamed draft rows, excluded from these counts.

Matching means a definition exists, not complete fidelity. Nine mapped definitions explicitly mark deferred Scorch relic handling; six dual lands need atomic entry timing review; other source/rule differences are listed below. Do not label all 71 fully ready.

**Verification:** 145 passing checks across six focused files: workbook-consumers, st01a-consumers, starter-hand-consumers, bounded-reveal, equipment and small-card-mechanics. No long socket suite, browser interaction or new per-card exhaustive certification. Those tests prove the exercised slices, not every workbook interaction.

## Sheet coverage

| Workbook sheet | Named rows | Existing definitions | No matching definition |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 炎獸 | 24 | 24 | 0 |
| 幻影木偶 | 23 | 5 | 18 |
| 風獸 | 23 | 9 | 14 |
| 冰龍 | 25 | 2 | 23 |
| 上使 | 23 | 3 | 20 |
| 蒼巨人 | 24 | 10 | 14 |
| 虛界靈 | 12 | 0 | 12 |
| BP01 - 元初大地 | 111 | 12 | 99 |
| 雙色補充包 | 12 | 6 | 6 |

## Ready foundation

Existing consumer evidence covers mana producers, ordinary creatures, typed/color/tribal targets, ordered draw/discard/mill/search/shuffle, temporary buffs, attack/entry/death triggers, optional choices, bounded reveal/reorder, selected counter effects, basic equipment and general replacement/prevention infrastructure.

Examples to build on: 帝國奴僕, 火槍團下等兵, 天犬, 風靈獸 魔豆/巧兔/舞狐, 諸界游歷者, 法蒂奧戰士, 幻影地界兵, 蒼海巡察組, 幻海人下士, 狂海幻力, 追求淨化之火 and 諸界烈刃. Read their consumer tests; these are not substitutes for tests of a newly authored card.

## Best first missing-card batch

| Card | Source | Existing pattern to reuse | Remaining work |
|---|---|---|---|
| 冰霜巨人 — conditional, not ready yet | 冰龍 row 8 | Vanilla creature stats | Its printed cost is 3寒2兵. Clarify 兵 before authoring; do not silently convert it to generic mana. |
| 幻影工兵 | 幻影木偶 row 4 | Self mill then filtered graveyard recovery | Ordered effects, black-creature filter, empty/eligible-choice tests |
| 諸界風靈使 | 風獸 row 8 | 赤狼-style top-three reveal | 幽爾 filter, optional selection/remainder order tests |
| 影木劍 | 幻影木偶 row 9 | Equipment host restriction + attack stat reduction | Phantom-puppet host filter, granted trigger, detach/reassign tests |
| 炎極兵刃 | BP01 row 9 | Equipment + attack draw | 炎獸 host filter and attack-trigger tests |
| 天域長槍 | 上使 row 9 | Equipment + ordered gain-life/draw | Printed attack modifier, host lifecycle and order tests |
| 吞雷聖劍 | 上使 row 19 | Tribal equipment + gain-three/draw | 上使 host filter and ordered consumer tests |
| 天域門衛 | 上使 row 5 | Block/destroy triggers + life/draw | Exact destruction versus death scope, two timing tests |

These are authoring candidates after reading the full row, not pre-implemented or guaranteed data-only. Confirm printed costs/stats and response timing as part of each batch.

## Resolve format and source differences first

- Workbook rule cell 游戲規則!A1 says default three copies, minimum 60 with no upper bound, opening seven and a mulligan. Current standard-v1 allows four copies, caps 250 and ordinary engine defaults open five. One mulligan and winner choosing first/second are not established by current game setup.
- Most printed unlimited lands are not in the current unlimitedCopies exception list: only land-red is unlimited. 幻影魔城 and 諸界海 print singleton limits that current eligibility does not encode. 幻影木偶 prints a special twenty-copy limit and is not authored yet.
- Current accepted Scorch creature threshold is attack plus maximum health; workbook text varies between energy value and fixed counters. Preserve the accepted interpretation until the owner decides otherwise. Relic threshold remains explicitly deferred on nine cards.
- Dual-land entry TAP is currently a trigger. Literal enters-tapped behavior requires atomic entry handling, not only rewriting the card text.
- Workbook customs differ from MTG-style priority/combat/turn machinery. Choose a versioned format/rules profile; do not silently change every rule while importing cards.
- Blank effects/placeholders are design questions, not engine tasks. Duplicate Void entries must be reconciled before assigning canonical IDs.
- Cost symbol 兵 appears in 霜月門衛 (1寒1兵) and 冰霜巨人 (3寒2兵), outside the current six colors/generic-cost mapping. Its meaning must be specified before these cards are treated as simple consumers.

## Mechanics to add or validate in separate slices

| Slice | Workbook consumers | Needed boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Void zone / starting selection | 虛界靈 sheet and BP01 Void support cards | New zone/lifecycle, starting-hand choice, activation permission and game UI |
| Graveyard casting / ritual summons | 幻影木偶/幻影巨人, 山谷巨龍, 冥者殿戰神 | Zone-aware timing/costs, material selection, summed requirements, provenance |
| Soul destruction | 冥者 series | Workbook rules Q8 define non-damage zero-life departure. Map this explicitly onto the current damage/toughness/SBA model, retain a semantic reason and implement its trigger consumers; do not treat every death as 魂滅. |
| Aurora / equipment counters | 極光冰龍, 巨龍的祝福, 霜月門衛 | Counter-granted rules and once-per-turn prevention; reuse generic replacements, do not rebuild damage |
| Per-game / special expiry | 風靈獸 狂獅大將軍哈爾, 極北王冠, next-turn freezes | Usage identity, reset semantics, combat/next-turn durations, skip untap |
| Stored cards under a host | 風靈獸 大酋長里昂, 天域三侯, 傀儡酋長 | Owned under-card zone, selection/release, host leave/re-entry and visibility |
| Tokens / created altars | 亞拉里亞最終兵器 天域神城, 雷巾祭壇 producers | Token creation/blueprints, cleanup, counts and serialization |
| Advanced combat / retargeting / dynamic ability text | Mandatory defenders, 冰風守護者, Void support effects | Explicit legal-action/UI contracts and regressions; not blanket JSON approximation |

Suggested order: format/eligibility decisions → first small card batch → remaining single-primitive consumers → shared mechanics slices → complex Void/ritual/hosted-card families. Use Scenario Lab fixtures per batch and short relevant socket checks only where a new interaction boundary needs them.

## Complete named-row inventory

Statuses below are definition coverage. Notes are source-review flags and routing hints, not automatic proof that a suggested mechanic is absent or sufficient. Existing definitions require an interaction audit before a full workbook-fidelity claim. The global format gaps apply even when a row has no individual deck note.
